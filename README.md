## Why should I read the book?
> The mission of Distributed computing with Go is to make reasoning about concurrency and parallelism, 
effortless and provide the reader with the confidence to design and implement such programs in Go. 
We will start by digging into the core concepts behind goroutines and channels, 
the two fundamental concepts in Go around which the language is built. 
Next, we will design and build a distributed search engine using Go and Go's standard library.

## Why not use external libaries?
Go is backwards compatible with its earlier versions. 
However, the libraries are not guaranteed to maintain compatibility (this might change with the new `dep` tool).
I want the code in the book to be executable at all times and not having external dependencies ensures this to be the case.

## Other external technologies used:
However, to make the reader's life simpler, we make use of Docker & `docker-compose`.
The code can still be run without these technologies though they might require slight change to be done by the user.


## Final Words
If you like the book, please leave a review on Amazon or on the portal where you read the book. 
It would definitely help me :)
